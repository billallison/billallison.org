# Instructions for copilot for billallison.org

## Main Guiding Principles:
1. Always follow Hugo conventions and do things "the Hugo way"
2. Never touch the README.md file - it is not to be replaced with generic Hugo information, it describes my homepage and is correct as-is
3. Never modify the submodules, always use overrides
4. All changes should be minimal: target only what's you're being asked to do
5. The website must be conformant to accessibility, adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA
6. Remember to recurse all the submodules so we have them locally.
