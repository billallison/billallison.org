Quite a while ago I set up this site using Wordpress in conjunction with a static site generator plugin. This was before Jekyll or Hugo had really taken off. Now I've migrated off my prior Unix host to Github (with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)), using Marcin Mierzejewski's clean [console theme](https://github.com/mrmierzejewski/hugo-theme-console/). I like the photos section- especially since I'm not really using Instagram anymore.
