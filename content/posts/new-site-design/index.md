This is the redesign of my personal website where I share occasional posts, snapshots and things. 
<!--more-->
Quite a while ago I set up this site using Wordpress, and a static site generator - before
Jekyll or Hugo had really taken off. Now I've migrated off my prior Unix host to Github and
onto Hugo, using Marcin Mierzejewski's clean [console theme](https://github.com/mrmierzejewski/hugo-theme-console/). 
I like the photo feature- especially since I'm not really using Instagram anymore.
