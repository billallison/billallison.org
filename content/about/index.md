I'm the Chief Technology Officer at the University of California at Berkeley, where [I lead the development of the University's technology strategy](https://cto.berkeley.edu/) and architecture. I've been working a lot on AI -- as well as automation, cloud computing, and innovation more generally. I am on a couple boards and advise startups including those at UC Berkeley's [SkyDeck](https://skydeck.berkeley.edu/) accelerator.
