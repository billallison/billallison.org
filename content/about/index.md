Welcome to my personal website. 

I'm the Chief Technology Officer at the University of California at Berkeley, where [I lead the development of the University's technology strategy](https://cto.berkeley.edu/) and tackle some of our most challenging technology problems-- most recently this involves thinking a lot about AI -- as well as automation, cloud computing, and innovation generally. In addition to my day job, I am involved on a couple boards, and advise startups including those at UC Berkeley's [SkyDeck](https://skydeck.berkeley.edu/) accelerator. 

Iâ€™ve live with my family in San Francisco.
